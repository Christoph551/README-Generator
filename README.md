## Installation
This uses the inquirer npm package. To install, simply navigate to the directory of the project you are working in and type `npm i inquirer@8.2.4` to install the npm package. 

## Usage
To begin answering questions, navigate to the directory of your project in the command line and type `node index`. This will begin with the first question and capture the user's input. Progress through each of the questions until completed. Once finished, then a README.md file will be generated with all of the user's input.
