## Usage

After you have installed the required npm packages, you'll want to type `node server` in order to initialize the local server (PORT 3001). From there, open up the browser to `http://localhost:3001`. This should display the home page to where you can click on the "Get Started" button. Simply type in a title for your note along with some text and you'll be able to save by clicking the save icon at the top right of the screen. Additionally, if you would like to delete a previous note, simply click on the red trash can icon to delete.
