## Installation
To install, simply navigate to the directory of the project you are working in using the command line. Then type `npm i inquirer@8.2.4` to install the npm package.

## Deployment
https://github.com/Christoph551/README-Generator

## Usage
To begin, open up the command line and change to the desired directory of a project you would like to generate a README.md file for. Once you have verified that you are in the correct directory, simply type `node index` to run the application. From there, begin by answering each of the questions.The application will take the user's input and generate a README.md file with all of the user's input as soon as the final question has been answered.

I recorded a video of myself answering each of these questions to demonstrate how the application functions. A link to that video can be found [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kSSxVqbywqSC9ENbQJpClpdFJgX-GyOH/view?usp=share_link)
